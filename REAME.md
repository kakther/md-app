# Version Notes

The version of this app currently uploaded is 1.0.0.  In cases where I update the README without any updates to the website itself I do not update the version number or use branches for my work.  Each version number will lack a commit number until the next version is uploaded.  The commit number is always added retroactively as it's generated at the time that I commit the project.  In general, for version number format X.Y.Z:
